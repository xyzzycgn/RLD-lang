viirld-dispatcher=Une station à proximité est activée dans la logistique ferroviaire.\nConnectez le signal avec le contenu de la station au port d'entrée.\nLorsque le train s'arrête, un signal avec des informations de livraison sera envoyé au port de sortie.

[mod-description]
viirld=Ajoute un répartiteur (bâtiment) pour automatiser la logistique ferroviaire en fonction des stations de fourniture et de demande.\n\nA une interface intuitive. S'est inspiré de LTN mais a pris une direction différente.

viirld=Rail Logistics Dispatcher 2(beta)

[mod-setting-description]
viirld-correctScheduleAtProvider=À l'arrivée à la station d'approvisionnement, la livraison peut être ajustée en fonction des changements d'approvisionnement et de demande survenus pendant que le train était en route vers la gare.
viirld-countingInsertersContent=Lors du calcul du contenu des stations, le signal entrant et le contenu du train sont pris en compte.\nCela entraîne parfois des sauts de contenu lors du chargement ou du déchargement, car une partie de la cargaison se trouve dans les inséreuses pendant un certain temps.\nCette option permet de comptabiliser le contenu des inséreuses.
viirld-debug=Active certains messages et indicateurs de débogage.
viirld-load-or-cond-full=Ajoutez la condition "OU Charge complète" sur les stations de ravitaillement.\n\nCe paramètre va à l'encontre de l'intention du mod et l'auteur ne recommande pas de l'activer.
viirld-minEnergyUseTrainMJ=The minimum amount of charged energy in a train to be used in deliveries.\nA train with an energy reserve less than specified will not be used for deliveries; it will remain at the depot.\nSpecified in megajoules (MJ).\n\nFor example: 100 MJ = 25 coal.
viirld-pauseNewDispatchers=Pause newly installed dispatchers if they have settings (copied or recreated from their ghost).\n\nThis can prevent deliveries from being created to the newly copied dispatcher.
viirld-set-train-group=Upon arrival at the depot, the train will be assigned a group whose name matches the name of the Depot station.\n\nDuring delivery, the train will leave the group and return to it again at the Depot.
viirld-unload-or-cond-zeros=Add condition "OR ? = 0" for each item or fluid on request stations.\n\nThis parameter goes against the intention of the mod and the author does not recommend enabling it.
viirld-updateTicks=Update station — it's a recount of its contents, settings, request, and supply.\n\nLower value — more frequent updates, more load on the CPU.\n\nNote that each station is updated no more than once every 60 ticks.
viirld-use-hack-to-save-interrupts=The lua api does not provide a way to save or change train interruptions — they are simply deleted when the schedule is changed.\n\nUntil Factorio adds such a feature, a workaround (hack) can be used.\n\nSome mods may interfere with this hack, so it may not work reliably.

EL_MODE_DEPOT=[item=locomotive] Depot
EL_MODE_DEPOT-tt=In the depot, trains wait for delivery tasks and refuel.\n\nA train always goes to the depot with the same name from which it left, finding it by the name of the station.\n\nIf you want to have different depots for different types of trains, name them differently.\n        \nIf a train with a small fuel supply or with cargo in the wagons, it will stand and wait until it is refueled and emptied.
EL_MODE_ENDPOINT=[item=passive-provider-chest] Supply / [item=requester-chest] Request
EL_MODE_ENDPOINT-tt=Depending on the settings and material signals, the station becomes a participant in delivery tasks.\n\nFor each type of cargo (solid or liquid), you can enable the Request or Supply mode.\n\nAlso may be configured the general mode [virtual-signal=signal-anything] - the request (<0) and offer (>0) will be taken from the signal on the dispatcher's input port.\n\nWhen two stations with a similar request and supply appear in the network, a delivery is created if there is a suitable train available.
EL_MODE_LIQUIDATION=[item=active-provider-chest] Liquidation
EL_MODE_LIQUIDATION-tt=Similar to the «[item=passive-provider-chest] Supply / [item=requester-chest] Request» mode, but with the following changes:\n- The request on this station is disabled;\n- The priority of the supply is the highest;\n- When requesting cargo from this station on other stations, it will be ignored at the minimum.\n\nUseful for to unload the cargo from the station, ready for destruction.

And the request station will display the same, but with a minus sign.\n\nNote that the option "Negate output" can change the sign: load — <0 and unload — >0.\n\neThe following signals are also sent to the output port:\n[virtual-signal=signal-P] — When there is a train, if this is a supply station. From the word Provider.\n[virtual-signal=signal-R] — When there is a train, if this is a request station. From the word Requester.\n[virtual-signal=signal-E] — When there are any errors.\n[virtual-signal=signal-D] — Number of active deliveries with this station.\n[virtual-signal=signal-L] — Length of the train, including locomotives.\n[virtual-signal=signal-C] — Number of cargo cars.\n[virtual-signal=signal-F] — Number of tank cars.
EL_OUT_MODE_NEGATE=Negate output
EL_OUT_MODE_NEGATE-tt=Changes the sign on the output port.\n\nFor the "Output required content" mode, the train contents required for sending will be with a minus sign.\nAnd for the "Output required exchange" mode, the signs will change: load — <0 and unload — >0.
EL_OUT_MODE_TARGET_CONTENTS=Output required content
EL_OUT_MODE_TARGET_CONTENTS-tt=The output port will display the contents of the train that are required to be sent.\n\nFor example, the supply station will display the cargo being loaded.

From the word Provider.\n[virtual-signal=signal-R] — When there is a train, if this is a request station. From the word Requester.\n[virtual-signal=signal-E] — When there are any errors.\n[virtual-signal=signal-D] — Number of active deliveries with this station.\n[virtual-signal=signal-L] — Length of the train, including locomotives.\n[virtual-signal=signal-C] — Number of cargo cars.\n[virtual-signal=signal-F] — Number of tank cars.
EL_PAUSE=Pause
EL_PAUSE-paused=[virtual-signal=viirld-delivery-pause] Unpause
EL_PAUSE-tt=It will pause the creation of deliveries at this station.\n\nIn the settings you can enable or disable automatic pausing of new dispatchers.\n\nAutomatic pausing can be done using the signal [virtual-signal=viirld-delivery-pause].\n\nYou cannot unpause with a button if it is set by the signal.
EL_ROLLBACK=Rollback
EL_STATION_TEMPLATE=Station name:
EL_STATION_TEMPLATE-tt=Template for automatic station renaming.\n\nFor the modes «[item=passive-provider-chest] Supply / [item=requester-chest] Request» or «[item=active-provider-chest] Liquidation» the field can use substitutions:\n- %d – corresponds to a number. Will be replaced with any number so that the station name becomes unique;\n- %s – corresponds to any string. Will be replaced with «blabla%d» so that the station name becomes unique;\n- %x – will be replaced with the x-coordinate of the station;\n- %y – will be replaced with the y-coordinate of the station;\n- %u – will be replaced with a unique station identifier.\n\nFor «[item=locomotive] Depot» there are no substitutions.\n\nPlease note that if the station name already matches the template, then the renaming will not occur, for example,\nif the station is already called "[item=iron-plate] Zheleznogorsk" (and there are no other stations with this name), then with the template "[item=iron-plate] %s" the renaming to "[item=iron-plate] blabla1" will not occur.\n\nExamples: \n- Template "[item=iron-plate] %d" → "[item=iron-plate] 1" or "[item=iron-plate] 2", ...\n- Template "[item=iron-plate] %s" → "[item=iron-plate] blabla1" or "[item=iron-plate] blabla2", ...\n- Template "[item=iron-plate] %xx%y" → "[item=iron-plate] 45x76"\n- Template "[item=iron-plate]" → "[item=iron-plate]1" - there is no %d or %s, so the number is added to the right.\n\nIf empty, the dispatcher does not update the station name.
